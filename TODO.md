### ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks

- [x] **Data Ingestion & Pre-processing**: Collect data from multiple sources (APIs, synthetic), validate and clean data
  - [x] Identify and configure data sources (Alpha Vantage, yfinance, CCXT, synthetic generators)
  - [x] Implement fetching functions for historical and live data
  - [x] Add data validation (schema checks, range validation, duplicate removal)
  - [x] Implement cleaning logic (handle NaNs, outliers, interpolation)
  - [x] Set up caching mechanism (e.g., local CSV/Parquet with expiration)
  - [x] Write unit tests for ingestion pipeline

- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: Generate technical indicators and temporal features, prepare data for CNN+LSTM models
  - [ ] Define core technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
  - [ ] Add temporal encodings (hour/day/week sine-cosine, holidays, market hours)
  - [ ] Integrate alternative data features (sentiment from news/social, if ready)
  - [ ] Implement normalization/scaling (MinMax, StandardScaler per-symbol)
  - [ ] Create sliding-window sequences for time-series input (e.g., lookback=60)
  - [ ] Ensure features are robust to missing data and varying timeframes
  - [ ] Add tests for feature computation determinism and shape consistency
