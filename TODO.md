# Trading RL Agent - Complete Task List

## Repository Cleanup & Audit Tasks

### âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] Audit and clean up the codebase: remove dead branches, unused variables, outdated tests, and empty/unused files
- [x] Run ruff and fix all automatically fixable issues
- [x] Remove empty and unused files (finrl_data_loader.py, cleanup_outputs.py, docker-compose.dev.yml)
- [x] Manually address remaining ruff errors and warnings (ALL FIXED! ðŸŽ‰)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Run final ruff check to ensure all issues are resolved âœ…
- [ ] Create summary report of all cleanup actions taken
- [ ] Verify all tests pass after cleanup
- [ ] Check for any broken imports or references after cleanup
- [ ] Final code quality review and documentation update
- [ ] Create comprehensive cleanup summary and next steps
