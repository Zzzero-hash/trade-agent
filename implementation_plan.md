# Implementation Plan

## Overview
The frontend is showing a white screen with no visible content or errors. This issue needs to be debugged and fixed to ensure the React application renders properly. The problem could be related to zustand store initialization, CSS styling issues, or component rendering problems.

## Types
No type system changes required. The issue is likely in component rendering or state management.

## Files
Single sentence describing file modifications.

Detailed breakdown:
- frontend/src/App.jsx - Add debugging logs and ensure proper component rendering
- frontend/src/stores/workflowStore.js - Add debugging and ensure proper store initialization
- frontend/src/App.css - Fix CSS issues that might be hiding content
- frontend/src/components/WorkflowTabs.css - Ensure proper tab styling
- frontend/src/main.jsx - Add error boundary improvements

## Functions
Single sentence describing function modifications.

Detailed breakdown:
- useWorkflowStore.setCurrentStep - Add debugging logs
- useWorkflowStore.nextStep - Add debugging logs
- useWorkflowStore.previousStep - Add debugging logs
- App.renderStep - Ensure proper step rendering
- ErrorBoundary.componentDidCatch - Improve error handling

## Classes
Single sentence describing class modifications.

Detailed breakdown:
- ErrorBoundary - Improve error handling and logging

## Dependencies
Single sentence describing dependency modifications.

No dependency changes required. All dependencies are properly installed.

## Testing
Single sentence describing testing approach.

Test the application by running the development server and checking browser console for errors, verifying component rendering, and ensuring state management works properly.

## Implementation Order
Single sentence describing the implementation sequence.

1. Add debugging logs to identify where the rendering fails
2. Fix CSS issues that might be hiding content
3. Improve error handling to catch and display errors
4. Test the application and verify the fix
5. Remove debugging code and finalize the implementation
