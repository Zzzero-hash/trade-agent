# Data Directory

This directory contains datasets and processed files for the trade agent project. Most files are excluded from Git due to their size or generated nature.

## File Types

### Sample Data (Included in Git)

- No sample data files are currently included (removed during cleanup)

### Generated Data Files (Not in Git)

These files are generated by the preprocessing pipeline and should not be committed:

- `features.parquet` - Processed feature data (~125KB)
- `large_fe.parquet` - Large feature engineering output (~125KB)
- `fe.parquet` - Feature engineering results (~10KB)
- `large_sample_data.parquet` - Large sample dataset (~59KB)
- No sample data Parquet files (removed during cleanup)

## How to Generate These Files

### Feature Engineering Data

Run the feature engineering pipeline:

```bash
python src/data/processing.py
```

### Sample Data Processing

Convert CSV to parquet format:

```bash
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')
df.to_parquet('data/sample_data.parquet')
"
```

### Large Feature Engineering

For large-scale feature engineering:

```bash
python src/data/unified_orchestrator.py --config configs/feature_config.json
```

## Data Sources

The original data sources should be:

1. Financial market data (configure your data provider)
2. Economic indicators
3. Technical indicators derived from price data

## Storage Recommendations

For production environments:

- Store large datasets in cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Use data versioning tools like DVC for large datasets
- Consider using Parquet or similar columnar formats for efficiency
- Implement data validation and quality checks

## File Size Guidelines

Files larger than 100MB should be stored externally and referenced via:

- DVC (Data Version Control)
- Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Cloud storage with configuration files

## Data Privacy

Ensure that:

- No sensitive financial data is committed to Git
- Production data follows your organization's data governance policies
- Sample data is anonymized and safe for sharing
