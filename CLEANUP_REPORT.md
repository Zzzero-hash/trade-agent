# Cleanup Report

This document summarizes the cleanup actions taken to improve the quality and maintainability of the Trading RL Agent codebase.

## ðŸ“‹ Summary of Completed Cleanup

1. **Code Quality & Linting**
   â€¢ Enabled Ruff across repository, resolved >150 issues; now zero lint warnings.
   â€¢ Added missing type annotations and modernised docstrings.

2. **Documentation**
   â€¢ Re-organised `docs/` with valid MyST `toctree` fences.
   â€¢ Mocked un-implemented modules in `conf.py` to keep Sphinx build green (now only 4 benign warnings).
   â€¢ Fixed all broken internal and external links.

3. **Testing**
   â€¢ Ensured 132 unit + smoke tests pass (âœ”).
   â€¢ Added import-sanity script (`scripts/check_imports.py`) and resolved all missing modules via lightweight placeholders.
   â€¢ Test coverage currently ~40 % â€“ acceptable for now, flagged for future improvement.

4. **Dependency Management**
   â€¢ Synced `requirements.txt` with runtime imports; added `nats-py`.

5. **Dead-code & File Audit**
   â€¢ Deleted stray/empty files & duplicate typo (`finrl_trading_eng.py`).
   â€¢ Removed redundant RST/MD files after apidoc refactor.

6. **New Placeholder Modules**
   â€¢ Added minimal classes in execution / portfolio sub-packages to unblock imports until full implementations arrive.

## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Data Pipeline Build-out (High priority)**
   â€¢ Implement robust ingestion from AV/YF/CCXT & caching layer.
   â€¢ Finalise feature-generation API and ensure deterministic outputs.

2. **Model Training Loop**
   â€¢ Flesh out `training/cnn_lstm.py` (currently 0 % covered) + lightning data module.
   â€¢ Integrate hyper-param search (Optuna/Ray Tune).

3. **Execution & Portfolio Layer**
   â€¢ Replace placeholders with working `BrokerInterface`, `ExecutionEngine`, `PortfolioManager` et al.
   â€¢ Provide risk checks before order routing.

4. **CI / Dev Experience**
   â€¢ Add GitHub Actions matrix (lint, pytest, docs).
   â€¢ Enforce coverage threshold â‰¥60 %.

5. **Documentation Polish**
   â€¢ Auto-generate API docs via `sphinx-autodoc` in CI.
   â€¢ Add tutorial notebooks.

6. **Security & Ops**
   â€¢ Secrets management (dotenv / vault).
   â€¢ Container hardening & image scanning.

Feel free to reprioritise or expand upon these suggestions as the project roadmap evolves.
