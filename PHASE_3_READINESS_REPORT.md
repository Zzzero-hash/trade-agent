- **Consolidated requirements** files (removed empty dev file)
- **Updated documentation** reflecting actual codebase state
- **Zero import errors** after cleanup operations

## üöÄ Phase 3 Development Readiness

### Multi-Asset Portfolio Foundation

The repository provides a solid foundation for multi-asset portfolio development:

1. **Trading Environment**: Single-asset environment ready for extension
2. **Agent Framework**: Modular design supports multiple assets
3. **Data Pipeline**: Robust processing for multiple data sources
4. **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive trading evaluation tools

### Development Infrastructure

- **Testing**: 367 automated tests ensure code reliability
- **Documentation**: Phase-specific guides and API documentation
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system for experimentation
- **Containerization**: Docker setup for consistent development

### Storage & Performance

- **Experimental Data**: 625.8 MB organized across data directories
- **Optimization Results**: 3.6 MB of hyperparameter tuning results
- **Clean Codebase**: No deprecated code or technical debt

## üìã Next Steps for Phase 3

### Immediate Development Targets

1. **Multi-Asset Environment Extension**
   - Extend trading environment to handle portfolio of assets
   - Implement portfolio-level observations and actions
   - Add portfolio rebalancing logic

2. **Portfolio Agent Development**
