## 🔭 Extended Roadmap

The following initiatives represent longer‑term goals for the project:

### Codebase Refactor & Quality
- Modularize around `src/data`, `src/envs`, `src/agents`, `src/training`, and `src/eval`.
- Convert the environment to a fully Gym‑compatible `TradingEnv` with transaction
  costs and slippage support.
- Externalize all configuration via YAML/CLI options.
- Expand CI with unit tests for reward calculation, data loaders, and environment resets.

### Advanced RL Algorithms
- Provide PPO and SAC baselines using Ray RLlib and PyTorch.
- Explore distributional RL approaches (C51, QR‑DQN, IQN) with risk‑adjusted rewards.
- Prototype multi‑agent training in a realistic market simulator (e.g., ABIDES).
- Use Ray Tune to sweep learning rates, entropy coefficients, and network widths.

### NLP & LLM Signal Pipeline
- Integrate FinGPT/FinBERT sentiment scoring with an asynchronous news feed.
- Cache sentiment signals and merge them into the RL observation space.
- Investigate LLM agent roles (fundamental, sentiment, risk) and aggregate their outputs.

### Hybrid / Ensemble Strategies
- Train CNN/LSTM price‑forecasting models and feed predictions to the RL state.
- Implement a regime classifier to condition or switch policies.
- Experiment with ensemble voting across multiple algorithms and random seeds.

### Backtesting & Evaluation
- Migrate to an event‑driven engine such as Backtrader or VectorBT.
- Simulate latency and order‑book slippage for realistic backtests.
- Automate walk‑forward tests in parallel with Ray.
- Log metrics including PnL, Sharpe, drawdown, and turnover on historical crash periods.

### Infrastructure & Scalability
- Provide Docker Compose files and Ray cluster configurations (local and k8s).
- Prototype GPU environment vectorization for large‑scale simulations.

### Deployment & Monitoring
- Package trained policies with Ray Serve for low‑latency inference.
- Add adapters for paper trading (Alpaca/Binance) with a shared interface.
- Export Prometheus/Grafana metrics and define fail‑safe rules for live trading.

### Documentation & Community
- Update the README with architecture diagrams and publish experiment notebooks.
- Mark good first issues to attract new contributors and track research papers.
