# Trade Agent Documentation

Welcome to the Trade Agent project documentation. This repository contains comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the project, including architecture, implementation details, and usage guidelines.

## Overview

The Trade Agent system is designed for automated trading strategies, with modular components for different aspects of the trading process. Key components include:

- **Portfolio Management**: Handles asset allocation and risk management.
- **Trading Environments**: Simulates trading environments for testing strategies.
- **Data Integration**: Connects to various data sources for market data.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Implements ML-based trading strategies.

## Architecture

### 1. Portfolio Management

- Manages asset allocation and risk exposure
- Implements modern portfolio theory-based strategies

### 2. Trading Environments

- Simulates real market conditions for strategy testing
- Includes reward calculation components

### 3. Data Integration

- Connects to multiple data sources
- Processes and formats market data for system use

### 4. Machine Learning Pipelines

- Implements various ML models for trading
- Includes both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches

## Key Features

### Portfolio Management

- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Dynamic asset allocation
- Performance tracking and reporting

### Trading Environments

- Real-time market simulation
- Reward calculation and feedback mechanisms
- Environment state management

### Data Integration

- Multiple data source connectors
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Cache and storage management

### Machine Learning Pipelines

## API Reference

### Portfolio Management API

```python
from trade_agent.portfolio import PortfolioManager

pm = PortfolioManager(risk_tolerance=0.05)
pm.rebalance_portfolio(asset_weights)
```

### Trading Environments API

```python
from trade_agent.envs import TradingEnvironment

env = TradingEnvironment(market_data, reward_function)
state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```
