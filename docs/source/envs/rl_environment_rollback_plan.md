# RL Environment Rollback Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the rollback procedures for the RL environment implementation, providing guidance on how to revert changes in case of issues during development, deployment, or production operation.

## 1. Rollback Scenarios

### 1.1 Environment Design Issues

**When**: Fundamental design flaws are discovered after implementation
**Action**: Revert to previous environment design
**Impact**: Medium - Requires reimplementation of components

### 1.2 Performance Issues

**When**: Environment fails to meet real-time performance requirements
**Action**: Remove newly created environment files and restore original approach
**Impact**: High - May require complete reimplementation

### 1.3 Integration Failures

**When**: Environment fails to integrate properly with SL predictions or RL agents
**Action**: Restore original environment approach
**Impact**: Medium - Requires reimplementation of integration points

### 1.4 Critical Bugs

**When**: Severe bugs affect system stability or financial calculations
**Action**: Revert to previous stable version
**Impact**: High - May affect trading performance

## 2. Rollback Procedures

### 2.1 Reverting to Previous Environment Design

**Procedure**:

1. Identify the last stable version of environment design documentation
2. Review changes made since that version
3. Create backup of current implementation
4. Replace current design documents with previous versions
5. Update implementation plan to match previous design
6. Communicate changes to development team

**Files to Restore**:

- `docs/envs/trading_environment.md` (previous version)
- `docs/envs/step5_rl_environment_detailed_plan.md` (previous version)
- `docs/envs/rl_environment_makefile_tasks.md` (previous version)
- `docs/envs/rl_environment_dag.md` (previous version)

### 2.2 Removing Newly Created Environment Files

**Procedure**:

1. Create backup of all environment files
2. Identify files created during current implementation
3. Remove newly created files in reverse dependency order
4. Update import statements in dependent modules
5. Verify system functionality with original environment
6. Document changes made

**Files to Remove**:

```

### 2.3 Restoring Original Environment Approach

**Procedure**:

1. Identify original environment implementation approach
2. Review documentation from previous steps
3. Remove all new environment components
4. Reimplement original environment design
5. Verify integration with SL predictions
6. Test with RL agents (PPO/SAC)
7. Validate performance requirements

**Steps to Restore Original Approach**:

1. Remove all files in `src/envs/` directory
2. Restore `docs/envs/trading_environment.md` to original version
3. Reimplement basic Gymnasium environment
4. Integrate with SL prediction interface
5. Implement basic reward function
6. Add transaction cost modeling
7. Implement risk management constraints

## 3. Backup and Recovery

### 3.1 Automated Backups

**Procedure**:

1. Create Git tags before major implementation phases
2. Use version control to track all changes
3. Create backup branches for experimental features
4. Document backup locations and procedures

**Backup Commands**:

```bash
# Create backup tag before major changes
git tag -a env-v1.0-backup -m "Backup before RL environment implementation"

# Create backup branch for experimental features
git checkout -b env-experimental-backup

# Push backups to remote repository
git push origin env-v1.0-backup
git push origin env-experimental-backup
```

### 3.2 Manual Backups

**Procedure**:

1. Create timestamped copies of critical files
2. Store backups in separate directory
3. Document backup contents and creation date
4. Verify backup integrity

**Manual Backup Commands**:

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p backups/envs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Copy critical files
cp -r src/envs backups/envs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
cp -r docs/envs backups/envs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/

# Create backup manifest
echo "Backup created on $(date)" > backups/envs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/manifest.txt
```

## 4. Verification Steps
