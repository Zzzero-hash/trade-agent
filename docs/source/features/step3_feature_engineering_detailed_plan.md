# Step 3: Feature Engineering Components - Detailed Plan

## Objective

Design and plan a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline for financial time-series data that extracts meaningful signals for both SL and RL models while preventing data leakage.

## 1. Feature Extraction Methodologies

### 1.1 Price-based Features

- **Returns**: Simple returns, log returns, cumulative returns over multiple time windows (1, 5, 10, 20, 50 days)
- **Price Ratios**: Open/close, high/low, high/close, low/open ratios
- **Moving Averages**: Simple, exponential, weighted moving averages with lookback periods of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 days
- **Price Volatility**: Standard deviation, variance, ATR (Average True Range) over multiple windows
- **Price Momentum**: Rate of change, price velocity, acceleration

### 1.2 Volume-based Features

- **Volume Moving Averages**: Simple and exponential moving averages with different lookback periods
- **Volume Ratios**: Current volume to average volume ratios
- **Volume Spikes**: Z-score or percentile-based detection of unusual volume
- **Volume-weighted Metrics**: Volume-weighted average price (VWAP), volume-weighted volatility

### 1.3 Technical Indicators

- **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R, CCI
- **Trend Indicators**: ADX, Aroon, Parabolic SAR
- **Volatility Indicators**: Bollinger Bands, ATR
- **Volume Indicators**: OBV, Chaikin Oscillator, MFI

### 1.4 Cross-sectional Features

- **Sector-relative Performance**: Asset return vs sector average return
- **Market Capitalization Factors**: Size-based features
- **Correlation with Market Indices**: Beta calculations, correlation coefficients
- **Relative Strength Measures**: Price performance relative to peers

### 1.5 Time-series Features

- **Lagged Values**: Past prices, returns, volumes at different lags (1, 2, 5, 10 days)
- **Rolling Window Statistics**: Mean, std, min, max, skew, kurtosis over different windows
- **Autocorrelation Measures**: Autocorrelation at different lags, partial autocorrelation
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Day-of-week, month-of-year effects

### 1.6 Advanced Feature Extraction

- **Automated Feature Generation**: Using tsfresh library for comprehensive time-series feature extraction
- **Fourier Transform Features**: Capturing cyclical patterns
- **Wavelet Transform Features**: Multi-scale analysis
- **Custom Financial Ratios**: Domain-specific metrics
- **Event-based Features**: Earnings announcements, economic indicators releases

## 2. Feature Selection Strategies

### 2.1 Statistical Methods

- **Variance Thresholding**: Remove features with low variance
- **Correlation Analysis**: Remove highly correlated features
- **Univariate Statistical Tests**: Chi-square test, ANOVA F-test
- **Missing Value Ratio**: Remove features with excessive missing values

### 2.2 Model-based Methods

- **Tree-based Feature Importance**: Random Forest, XGBoost feature importance
- **Linear Model Coefficients**: Lasso regression for automatic feature selection
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively remove least important features
- **Permutation Importance**: Measure decrease in model performance when features are shuffled

### 2.3 Time-series Specific Methods

- **Granger Causality Tests**: Determine if one time series can predict another
- **Cross-correlation Analysis**: Identify lagged relationships between features and targets
- **Cointegration Tests**: Find long-term equilibrium relationships

## 3. Feature Scaling and Normalization Approaches

### 3.1 Min-Max Scaling

- Transform features to a fixed range (typically 0 to 1)
- Best for features without extreme outliers

### 3.2 Z-score Standardization

- Center features around zero with unit variance
- Suitable for normally distributed features

### 3.3 Robust Scaling

- Use median and IQR instead of mean and std
- Less sensitive to outliers

### 3.4 Rank Transformation

- Convert features to their rank order
- Useful for non-normal distributions

## 4. Handling of Categorical and Time-based Features

### 4.1 Categorical Features

- **One-hot Encoding**: For low-cardinality categories
- **Label Encoding**: For ordinal categories
- **Target Encoding**: For high-cardinality categories using historical data only

### 4.2 Time-based Features

- **Basic Time Components**: Year, month, day, day of week, hour, minute
- **Cyclical Encoding**: Sine/cosine transformations for periodic features
- **Time Since Events**: Days since specific events or market open
- **Market Calendar Features**: Trading day vs non-trading day indicators

## 6. Integration with Data Pipeline from Step 2

The feature engineering pipeline integrates with the data pipeline after the Data Cleaning stage and before the Normalization stage:

```
Data Sources → Raw Data Storage → Data Validation → Data Cleaning →
Feature Engineering → Normalization → Data Splitting → Processed Data Storage
```

### 6.1 Integration Requirements

- **Input/Output Compatibility**: Accept output from data cleaning and produce input for normalization

### 6.2 Data Flow Integration

- **Batch Processing**: Handle large datasets that might not fit in memory
