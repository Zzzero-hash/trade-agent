# Trading System Architecture Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete trading system architecture, integrating all components into a cohesive framework for algorithmic trading using reinforcement learning.

## System Overview

The trading system follows a modular architecture that processes market data through multiple stages to generate executable trading signals. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, enabling independent development and testing of each component.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Modularity

Each component is designed as an independent module with well-defined interfaces, enabling:

- Independent development and testing
- Easy replacement of individual components
- Parallel development by multiple teams

### 2. Data Integrity

Special attention is paid to prevent data leakage:

- Temporal alignment in feature engineering

### 3. Risk Management

Built-in risk controls at multiple levels.

### 4. Performance Optimization

The system is designed for efficiency.
