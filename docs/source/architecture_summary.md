# Trading System Architecture Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete trading system architecture, integrating all components into a cohesive framework for algorithmic trading using reinforcement learning.

## System Overview

The trading system follows a modular architecture that processes market data through multiple stages to generate executable trading signals. The system is designed with clear separation of concerns, enabling independent development and testing of each component.
