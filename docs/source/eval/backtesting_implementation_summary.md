# Backtesting Implementation Summary

## 1. Overview of the Backtesting Implementation

The backtesting implementation provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating trading strategies within the trade-agent system. It enables users to simulate trading strategies on historical data, calculate performance metrics, conduct stress tests, and generate detailed reports.

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **BacktestEngine**: The core engine that runs backtests on trading strategies, handling transaction costs, slippage, and performance calculations.
2. **StressTester**: A component that performs stress testing on strategies under various market conditions.
3. **ReportGenerator**: A utility for generating comprehensive reports in HTML and CSV formats.

## 2. Key Features Implemented

The backtesting module includes several important features:

- **Out-of-sample testing**: The framework supports testing strategies on unseen data to evaluate their robustness.
- **Transaction cost and slippage modeling**: Realistic transaction cost simulation with configurable parameters.
- **Comprehensive performance metrics calculation**: A wide range of metrics to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Stress testing capabilities**: Evaluation of strategy performance under adverse market conditions.
- **Multiple report formats**: Generation of reports in HTML, CSV, and PNG formats.
- **Equity curve visualization**: Visual representation of strategy performance over time.

## 3. List of All Files Created

The following files were created as part of the backtesting implementation:

1. `src/eval/backtest.py` - Core backtesting module with BacktestEngine, StressTester, and ReportGenerator classes
2. `scripts/run_backtest.py` - Demonstration script showing how to use the backtesting module
3. `Makefile` - Updated with backtesting task
4. `docs/eval/backtesting_usage_guide.md` - Detailed usage guide for the backtesting module

## 4. How to Use the Backtesting Module (with Makefile Task)

The backtesting module can be used in two ways:

### Using the Makefile Task

The simplest way to run a backtest is to use the provided Makefile task:

```bash
make backtest
```

This command will:

1. Check for the required data file (`data/large_sample_data.parquet`)
2. Run the demonstration script `scripts/run_backtest.py`
3. Generate all reports in the `reports/` directory
4. Print a summary of key metrics to the console

### Using the Demonstration Script Directly

You can also run the demonstration script directly:

```bash
python scripts/run_backtest.py
```

This script will:

1. Load sample data from `data/large_sample_data.parquet`
2. Create a simple moving average crossover strategy
3. Run the backtest using the BacktestEngine
4. Generate all reports (HTML/CSV) to the `/reports/` directory
5. Print a summary of key metrics to the console

### Using the Module Directly

For more control, you can run the backtest module directly with command-line arguments:

```bash
python src/eval/backtest.py --data data/sample_data.csv --output-dir reports
```

Available command-line options:

- `--data`: Path to the data file (required)
- `--output-dir`: Output directory for reports (default: "reports")
- `--transaction-cost`: Transaction cost per trade (default: 0.001)
- `--slippage`: Slippage per trade (default: 0.0005)
- `--initial-capital`: Initial capital for backtest (default: 100000.0)
- `--no-stress-test`: Skip stress testing

## 5. Summary of Outputs Generated

The backtesting module generates several output files in the specified output directory (default: "reports"):

### HTML Reports

- `backtest_report.html`: A comprehensive HTML report containing performance metrics and stress test results in a user-friendly format.

### CSV Reports

- `trades_backtest_results.csv`: Detailed information about individual trades executed during the backtest.
- `metrics_backtest_results.csv`: All calculated performance metrics in CSV format.
- `equity_backtest_results.csv`: The equity curve data showing gross and net equity over time.

### PNG Plots

- `equity_curve.png`: A visualization of the strategy's equity curve, showing both gross and net equity over time.

## 6. List of Performance Metrics Calculated

The backtesting module calculates a comprehensive set of performance metrics:

### Return Metrics

- **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: The annualized rate of return of the strategy.
- **Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation of returns.

### Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return calculated as (return - risk_free_rate) / volatility.
- **Calmar Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return calculated as CAGR / |Max Drawdown|.

### Drawdown Metrics

- **Max Drawdown**: The maximum peak-to-trough decline in the equity curve.

### Trading Metrics

- **Turnover**: Annualized measure of the strategy's trading activity.
- **Hit Ratio**: The percentage of winning trades.
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.

### Statistical Metrics

- **Skewness**: Measure of the asymmetry of the return distribution.
- **Kurtosis**: Measure of the "tailedness" of the return distribution.
- **PnL Autocorrelation**: First-order autocorrelation of returns, indicating time-series dependence.

### Benchmark Metrics (when benchmark data is provided)

- **Information Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return relative to a benchmark.
- **Tracking Error**: Standard deviation of active returns relative to a benchmark.

## 7. Summary of Stress Tests Implemented

The stress tester evaluates strategy performance under adverse market conditions:

### Â±50% Costs

- **High Costs**: Tests strategy performance with 1.5x transaction costs and slippage.
- **Low Costs**: Tests strategy performance with 0.5x transaction costs and slippage.

These tests help evaluate the robustness of a strategy to changes in trading costs.

### Fill Delay +1 Bar

This test simulates execution delays by shifting trading signals by one additional bar. This evaluates how the strategy performs when there are delays between signal generation and execution.

When interpreting stress test results, look for:

- Strategies that maintain positive performance under stress
- Strategies with minimal performance degradation under stress
- Strategies with consistent risk metrics across stress scenarios
