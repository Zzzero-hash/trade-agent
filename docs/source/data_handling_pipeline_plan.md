# Data Handling and Preprocessing Pipeline Plan

## Objective

Design and plan a robust data handling pipeline for time-series financial data that prevents data leakage and ensures deterministic processing.

## 1. Data Storage Strategy and Formats

### Storage Formats

- **Raw Data**: Parquet format for efficient storage and retrieval
- **Processed Data**: Parquet format with clear naming conventions
- **Temporary Data**: Parquet format stored in `data/temp/` directory
- **Metadata**: JSON format stored alongside data files

### Directory Structure

```
data/
├── raw/              # Raw downloaded data
├── processed/        # Cleaned and processed data
├── splits/           # Train/validation/test splits
├── temp/             # Temporary files
└── metadata/         # Metadata files
```

### Data Organization

- Data organized by date for efficient temporal operations
- Separate directories for different data types (OHLCV, tick data, alternative data)
- Version control friendly with clear file naming conventions

## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing Pipeline

### Pipeline Components

1. **Data Loading**: Reads data from storage formats
2. **Data Validation**: Checks for data quality issues
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and outliers
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creates derived features
5. **Normalization**: Scales features appropriately
6. **Output**: Processed data ready for modeling

### Pipeline Flow

```
Raw Data → Validation → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Normalization → Processed Data
```

### Key Features

- Modular design for easy addition/removal of components
- Configurable validation rules
- Flexible feature engineering modules
- Leakage prevention at each stage

## 3. Train/Validation/Test Split Methodology

### Split Strategy

- **Temporal Splits**: Chronological division (no random shuffling)
- **Standard Split**: 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing
- **Walk-Forward**: Multiple splits for time-series analysis

### Implementation

- Training data from earliest time period
- Validation data from middle time period
- Test data from most recent time period
- Consistent splits across multiple assets

## 4. Data Validation and Quality Checks

### Validation Types

1. **Missing Data Detection**: Identifies gaps in time series
2. **Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods (z-scores, IQR)
3. **Consistency Checks**: Logical validations (negative prices, etc.)
4. **Temporal Validation**: Timestamp ordering and gaps
5. **Integrity Checks**: Corporate actions and data consistency

### Reporting

- Comprehensive validation reports
- Summary statistics of data quality
- Detailed logs of issues found
- Recommendations for addressing issues

## 5. File Paths for Data-Related Components

### Data Directories

- `data/raw/`: Raw downloaded data
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and processed data
- `data/splits/`: Train/validation/test splits
- `data/temp/`: Temporary processing files
- `data/metadata/`: Metadata files

### Source Code Directories

- `src/data/collectors/`: Data collection modules
- `src/data/storage/`: Storage interfaces
- `src/data/validators/`: Data validation modules
- `src/data/pipelines/`: Main processing pipelines
- `src/data/config/`: Configuration files

### Documentation

- `docs/data/processing.md`: Data processing documentation
- `docs/data/validation.md`: Data validation procedures
- `docs/data/storage.md`: Data storage strategies

## 6. Data Leakage Prevention Mechanisms

### Key Prevention Strategies

1. **Temporal Splits**: Strict chronological separation
2. **Feature Engineering**: Only past information used
3. **Normalization**: Parameters computed only on training data
4. **Validation/Cleaning**: Methods fitted only on training data
5. **Data Encapsulation**: Strict interfaces for data access

### Implementation

- Validation tests to ensure no future data leakage
- Clear boundaries between training/validation/test data
- Automated leakage detection in pipeline

## 7. Deterministic Splits with Fixed Seeds

### Seed Usage

- Seeds determine split parameters (percentages, dates)
- Same seed always produces same splits
- Consistent splits across multiple assets

### Implementation

- Seed-based parameter generation
- Fixed rounding rules for edge cases
- Storage of split parameters for reproducibility

## 8. Handling of Missing Data

### Missing Data Types

1. **Predictable**: Market holidays, known gaps
2. **Random**: Data feed issues, transmission errors

### Imputation Strategies

1. **Calendar-based**: For predictable missing data
2. **Forward-fill/Backward-fill**: For time-series data
3. **Interpolation**: For short gaps
4. **Statistical**: Mean/median imputation
5. **Model-based**: Kalman filtering, advanced methods

### Implementation

- Missing data indicators as additional features
- Imputation parameters computed only on training data
- Comprehensive logging of all imputation operations

## 9. Performance Benchmarks

### Time-Based Metrics

- Data loading time
- Validation time
- Cleaning/preprocessing time
- Feature engineering time
- Normalization time
- Total pipeline execution time

### Resource-Based Metrics

- Memory usage during each stage
- CPU utilization
- Disk I/O operations
- Network usage (if downloading data)

### Quality Metrics

- Percentage of missing data before/after imputation
- Number of outliers detected/handled
- Data consistency checks passed
- Validation errors encountered

### Scalability Testing

- Small datasets (single asset, one year)
- Medium datasets (100 assets, 5 years)
- Large datasets (1000+ assets, 10+ years)
