# SAC Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent implementation for the trading system. The SAC agent is designed to work with the existing trading environment and follows the same architectural patterns as the PPO agent implementation.

## Key Components

### 1. SACFeatureExtractor

Processes the complex 514-dimensional observation space of the trading environment into fixed-size feature vectors suitable for the SAC policy network.

**Key Features**:

- Handles feature windows, predictions (mu_hat, sigma_hat), position, and cash/equity ratio
- Outputs fixed-size feature vector (default: 64 dimensions)
- Compatible with Stable-baselines3 feature extractor interface

### 2. SACAgent

High-level interface that wraps Stable-baselines3's SAC implementation with a consistent API.

**Key Features**:

- Compatible interface with PPOAgent for ensemble combiner integration
- Deterministic processing with fixed seeds
- Model persistence (save/load functionality)
- Financial domain-specific hyperparameters

## Architecture Integration

The SAC agent integrates with the existing system architecture:

```
Market Data → Features → SL Predictions → Trading Environment → SAC Agent → Actions
```

### Integration Points

1. **Trading Environment**: Compatible with Gymnasium interface
2. **Observation Space**: Handles 514-dimensional observations
3. **Action Space**: Produces continuous actions in [-1, 1] range
4. **Ensemble Combiner**: Compatible interface with PPO agent

## Hyperparameters

### SAC Algorithm Settings

- `learning_rate`: 3e-4 (standard for financial applications)

### Training Configuration

- `total_timesteps`: 1,000,000
- `eval_freq`: 10,000
- `checkpoint_freq`: 50,000
