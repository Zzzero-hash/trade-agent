# SAC Agent Rollback Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the rollback procedures for the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent implementation. It provides step-by-step instructions for reverting changes in case of critical failures or issues during implementation, testing, or deployment.

## Rollback Scenarios

### 1. Implementation Failure

- Critical bugs in SAC agent code
- Integration issues with trading environment
- Performance below acceptable thresholds

### 2. Testing Failure

- Failed unit tests
- Failed integration tests
- Failed acceptance tests

### 3. Deployment Failure

- Production deployment issues
- Runtime errors in production
- Performance degradation in production

### 4. Data Corruption

- Model file corruption
- Configuration file corruption
- Training data issues

## Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation

#### Step 1: Issue Identification

1. Identify the specific failure or issue
2. Document error messages and symptoms
3. Determine the scope of impact
4. Assess urgency and priority

#### Step 2: Environment Assessment

1. Check current system state
2. Verify backup availability
3. Confirm rollback target version
4. Ensure rollback tools are available

#### Step 3: Communication

1. Notify stakeholders of rollback plan
2. Set expectations for downtime/impact
3. Coordinate with team members
4. Document rollback start time

### Phase 2: Implementation Rollback

#### Step 4: Code Rollback

1. Identify files to be rolled back:
   - `src/rl/sac/sac_agent.py`
   - `src/rl/sac/sac_features.py`
   - `src/rl/sac/__init__.py`

2. Restore from version control:

   ```bash
   git checkout <last_stable_commit> -- src/rl/sac/
   ```

3. Verify file restoration:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

#### Step 5: Configuration Rollback

1. Identify configuration files to be rolled back:
   - `configs/sac_config.json`

2. Restore configuration from backup:

   ```bash
   cp backups/sac_config.json configs/
   ```

3. Verify configuration integrity

#### Step 6: Documentation Rollback

1. Identify documentation files to be rolled back:
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent_detailed_plan.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent_summary.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent_acceptance_tests.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_configuration.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_file_tree_structure.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent_makefile_tasks.md`
   - `docs/agents/sac_agent_dag.md`

2. Restore documentation from version control or backups

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

#### Step 7: Environment Validation

1. Verify development environment:

   ```bash
   python -c "import src.rl.sac.sac_agent"
   ```

2. Check trading environment compatibility:

   ```bash
   python scripts/test_env_compatibility.py
   ```

3. Validate configuration files:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_config.py configs/sac_config.json
   ```

#### Step 8: Test Execution

1. Run unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/rl/sac/test_sac_agent.py -v
   pytest tests/rl/sac/test_sac_features.py -v
   ```

2. Run integration tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/rl/sac/test_sac_integration.py -v
   ```

3. Run acceptance tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/rl/sac/test_sac_acceptance.py -v
   ```

#### Step 9: Performance Validation

1. Execute smoke tests:

   ```bash
   python scripts/smoke_test_sac.py
   ```

2. Verify model loading/saving:

   ```bash
   python scripts/test_model_persistence.py
   ```

3. Check deterministic behavior:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_deterministic.py
   ```

### Phase 4: Deployment Rollback

#### Step 10: Development Environment

1. Uninstall current version:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall trade-agent-sac
   ```

2. Install previous stable version:

   ```bash
   pip install trade-agent-sac==<previous_version>
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python -c "import src.rl.sac; print('SAC module loaded successfully')"
   ```

#### Step 11: Production Environment

1. Stop current SAC agent services:

   ```bash
   systemctl stop sac-agent-service
   ```

2. Deploy previous stable version:

   ```bash
   # Deploy previous version using CI/CD pipeline
   ```

3. Start services:

   ```bash
   systemctl start sac-agent-service
   ```

4. Monitor deployment:
   ```bash
   systemctl status sac-agent-service
   ```

### Phase 5: Verification and Communication

#### Step 12: System Verification

1. Verify system functionality:
   - Check trading environment integration
   - Verify model performance
   - Confirm no data loss

2. Monitor system metrics:
   - CPU and memory usage
   - Response times
   - Error rates

3. Validate business metrics:
   - Trading performance
   - Risk metrics
   - Transaction costs

#### Step 13: Stakeholder Communication

1. Notify stakeholders of rollback completion:
   - Send status update email
   - Update project tracking system
   - Schedule post-rollback review

2. Document rollback results:
   - Record rollback duration
   - Document issues encountered
   - Note lessons learned

3. Plan next steps:
   - Schedule root cause analysis
   - Plan re-implementation timeline
   - Update risk mitigation strategies
