# Architecture Summary

The Trade Agent system is built with a modular architecture, allowing for flexibility and scalability. Below is a high-level overview of the system's components and their interactions.

## 1. Portfolio Management

- **Location**: `src/common/portfolio`
- **Description**: Manages asset allocation and risk exposure.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `PortfolioManager`: Handles portfolio rebalancing and risk assessment.
  - `RiskManager`: Implements risk mitigation strategies.

## 2. Trading Environments

- **Location**: `src/integrations/enhanced_trading_env`
- **Description**: Simulates trading environments for strategy testing.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `TradingEnvironment`: Base class for different market simulations.
  - `RewardCalculator`: Computes rewards based on trading performance.

## 3. Data Integration

- **Location**: `src/integrations/data_trading_bridge`
- **Description**: Connects to various data sources and processes market data.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `DataBridge`: Handles data fetching and transformation.
  - `DataCache`: Stores processed data for quick access.

## 4. Machine Learning Pipelines

- **Location**: `src/sl/pipelines`
- **Description**: Implements ML-based trading strategies.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `MLPipeline`: Abstract class for different ML models.
  - `CNNLSTMModel`: Example model using CNN and LSTM architectures.

## 5. Reinforcement Learning

- **Location**: `src/rl`
- **Description**: Implements RL agents for trading strategies.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `PPolicyGradient`: PPO agent implementation.
  - `SACAgent`: Soft Actor-Critic agent.

## 6. Evaluation and Backtesting

- **Location**: `src/sl/evaluation`
- **Description**: Evaluates trading strategies and backtests models.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `Backtester`: Runs backtests on different strategies.
  - `Evaluator`: Analyzes performance metrics.

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Location**: `conf/`
- **Description**: Manages configuration and dependencies.
- **Key Files**:
  - `config.yaml`: System-wide configuration.
  - `search_space/`: Defines hyperparameter spaces for models.

## 8. Deployment and Monitoring

- **Location**: `src/serve`
- **Description**: Deploys models and monitors trading activities.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `ModelServer`: Serves ML models for real-time decisions.
  - `TradingMonitor`: Monitors trading performance and alerts on anomalies.

This architecture ensures that each component is decoupled, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
