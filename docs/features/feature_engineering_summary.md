# Feature Engineering Components - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive plan for implementing feature engineering components for financial time-series data that extracts meaningful signals for both SL and RL models while preventing data leakage.

## Key Components

### 1. Feature Extraction Methodologies

- **Price-based Features**: Returns, ratios, moving averages, volatility measures
- **Volume-based Features**: Volume moving averages, ratios, spikes, weighted metrics
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ADX, OBV, etc.
- **Cross-sectional Features**: Sector-relative performance, market cap factors
- **Time-series Features**: Lagged values, rolling statistics, autocorrelation
- **Advanced Features**: Fourier/wavelet transforms, custom financial ratios

### 2. Feature Selection Strategies

- **Statistical Methods**: Variance thresholding, correlation analysis
- **Model-based Methods**: Tree importance, Lasso regression, RFE
- **Time-series Methods**: Granger causality, cointegration tests

### 3. Feature Scaling and Normalization

- **Min-Max Scaling**: Fixed range transformation
- **Z-score Standardization**: Mean-centered with unit variance
- **Robust Scaling**: Median and IQR-based
- **Rank Transformation**: Order-based transformation

### 4. Categorical and Time-based Feature Handling

- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot, label, and target encoding
- **Time-based Features**: Cyclical encoding, time since events

## Integration with Data Pipeline

The feature engineering pipeline integrates after Data Cleaning and before Normalization:
`Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Normalization`

## Quality Assurance

- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Temporal alignment, parameter isolation
- **Deterministic Processing**: Fixed seeds, state management
- **Feature Quality**: Importance thresholds, variance checks
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Execution time, memory usage

## Deployment

- **Makefile Tasks**: 25 implementation, testing, and deployment tasks
- **DAG Representation**: Visual workflow of feature engineering pipeline
- **Rollback Procedures**: Revert strategies for all components

## Files Created

1. `docs/features/step3_feature_engineering_detailed_plan.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan
2. `docs/features/feature_engineering_makefile_tasks.md` - Makefile-style task list
3. `docs/features/feature_engineering_dag.md` - DAG representation of the pipeline

This completes the detailed planning for Step 3: Feature engineering components.
